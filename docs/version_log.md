- **Audit Logger** (`src/core/audit.ts`) — Comprehensive action logging (tools, errors, failovers, sessions). JSONL format with automatic rotation (max 10 files, 1000 entries each). Auto-subscribes to event bus.
- **Session Manager** (`src/core/sessions.ts`) — Browse, search, restore, and clean up past conversations. Full-text search across session history. Session statistics.

#### 🚀 New Skills (4 additions, 13 total)
1. **HTTP Requests** (`src/skills/http.ts`) — GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE with headers, body, auth. Response truncation (10KB max), timing info, error handling.
2. **Network Diagnostics** (`src/skills/network.ts`) — 9 actions: ping, traceroute, DNS, port check, connections, interfaces, ARP, routing, WHOIS.
3. **Process Manager** (`src/skills/process-manager.ts`) — 10 actions: list, search, kill, start/stop/restart services, startup apps, resource hogs.
4. **Deep System Info** (`src/skills/system-info.ts`) — 12 actions: overview, hardware, storage, software, updates, drivers, events, security, battery, environment, uptime, users.
