## ⚡ How to Start

The fastest way to launch PersonalClaw is using the included batch files:

1. **Setup**: Run `setup.bat` once to install dependencies and configure your API key.
2. **Launch**: Run `start.bat`. This will automatically:
   - Start the Backend server (port 3000)
   - Start the Dashboard frontend (port 5173)
   - Open your browser to the dashboard.

Alternatively, you can run `npm run all` in a single terminal.

Wait a few seconds for initialization, then head to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)!

## 🏢 AI Organisation System (v12)

PersonalClaw supports creating autonomous AI companies that work on your projects without constant human intervention.

### 1. Creating an Organisation
- Click the **Organisations** tab in the sidebar.
- Click **Add Organisation** to define a new company.
- **Mission**: Tell the org what its ultimate goal is.
- **Root Directory**: Point the org to a real folder on your disk. This is where the agents will work.

### 2. Building Your Team
Once an org is created, you can add multiple AI agents with specialized roles:
- **Role & Personality**: Define a CEO, a lead developer, a copywriter, etc.
- **Responsibilities**: List exactly what this agent is in charge of.
- **Autonomy**: Set whether the agent can act freely (**Full**) or needs your consent (**Approval Required**).
- **Heartbeat (Cron)**: Set a schedule for the agent to wake up and work (e.g., "Every 30 minutes" or "Every Monday at 9 AM").
- **Reports To**: Set the agent's reporting line via the dropdown in the Edit Agent modal. Shows agent name and role for each option.

### 3. The Ticket Board (Kanban)
Each organisation comes with a built-in task management system:
- **Agents Assign Work**: Agents can create and assign tickets to each other (or to you!).
- **Status Tracking**: Move tasks between **Open**, **In Progress**, **Blocked**, and **Done**.
- **Agent Collaboration**: Agents check the ticket board on every run to see what needs doing.

### 4. Board of Directors
The **Board** tab is your org command center:
- **Summary bar**: Open blockers, active agents, token usage at a glance.
- **Org chart**: Visual hierarchy of agents and reporting lines.
- **Blockers**: Resolve blockers that need human attention with resolution notes.
- **Agent Health**: Click any agent health card to expand it and see full run summaries, all file activity, and run history.

### 5. Workspace Tab
The **Workspace** tab lets you browse and interact with files agents have created:
- **Organised by agent role**: Each agent gets a collapsible section showing their files.
- **Inline editor**: Click any file to view and edit it in a textarea editor.
- **Human comments**: Leave comments on any file. When the agent runs next, your comments are injected into its system prompt so it can act on your feedback.
- Comments are stored as sidecar `.comments.json` files (hidden from the file browser).

### 6. Proposals Tab
The **Proposals** tab shows only **code change proposals** — changes agents want to make to protected files.
- Documents, plans, and hiring decisions are **auto-approved** and do not appear here.
- Review the original vs proposed diff, then approve or reject.

### 7. Direct Agent Chat
Need to talk to a specific agent privately?
- Click the **💬 Chat** icon on any agent card in the Org Workspace.
- This opens a persistent, dedicated chat pane with just that agent.
- Unlike the main command center, these agents remember who they are (CEO/Dev) and what they've been doing.

### 8. Protection Settings
The **Settings** tab lets you control which files agents must submit proposals to modify:
- **Modes**: None (agents write freely), Git (all git-tracked files protected), Manual (specific paths), Both.
- **View protected files**: Expand the "View all protected files" section to see every protected file, grouped by directory.
- **Refresh from git**: Re-snapshot git-tracked files after you've added new files to the repo.
