Welcome to **PersonalClaw v10.0**, your next-generation AI agent for Windows. This guide teaches you to leverage its full power.

---

## 🌟 What is PersonalClaw?

PersonalClaw is a sophisticated, locally-hosted AI agent powered by **Google Gemini** with intelligent failover. It gives you AI-powered control over your Windows machine via:

- **Web Dashboard** — Real-time chat, system metrics, activity feed, command palette
- **Telegram Bot** — Control from anywhere securely
- **REST API** — External integrations

---

## ⚡ How to Start
To launch the PersonalClaw system, you need to run two separate commands in different terminal windows:

1. **The Brain**: In the project root, run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. **The Dashboard**: Navigate to the `dashboard` folder and run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Persistence Mode**: For absolute stability (prevents browsers from closing during code changes):
   ```bash
   npm run dev:persist
   ```

Wait a few seconds for both to initialize, then head to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)!
