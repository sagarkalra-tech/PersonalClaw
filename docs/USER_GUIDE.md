Welcome to **PersonalClaw**, your high-performance AI agent for Windows automation and remote control. This guide will help you master your new digital companion.

---

## 🌟 Introduction
PersonalClaw is a private, local AI agent powered by **Gemini 3 Flash**. It gives you eyes and hands on your Windows machine, accessible via a web dashboard or a secure Telegram bot.

---

## ⚡ How to Start
To launch the PersonalClaw system, you need to run two separate commands in different terminal windows:

1. **The Brain**: In the project root, run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. **The Dashboard**: Navigate to the `dashboard` folder and run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Persistence Mode**: For absolute stability (prevents browsers from closing during code changes):
   ```bash
   npm run dev:persist
   ```

Wait a few seconds for both to initialize, then head to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)!
