## AI Logic (Brain Loop)

PersonalClaw runs a **multi-turn tool execution loop**:
1. Human or Heartbeat triggers an agent.
2. If Heartbeat: OrgAgentRunner creates a Brain with **Persona Injection** (Mission + Role).
3. Brain checks Task Board and Memory, then builds a Plan.
4. **Human comments** on workspace files are injected into the system prompt so agents can act on feedback.
5. Tools execute via `handleToolCall`, acquiring global/per-path locks.
6. Protected file writes are intercepted and routed to the proposal system.
7. Non-code submissions (documents, plans, hiring) are auto-approved unless `requiresApproval: true`.
8. Loop repeats until the agent has achieved its run goals or delegates.
9. Run summary is recorded and session history is saved.

## Key Technologies
- Runtime: Node.js with TypeScript (tsx for dev, tsc for build)
- AI Model: Google Gemini (API key in .env)
- Backend: Express + Socket.io for real-time communication
- Frontend: React + Vite dashboard
- Browser Automation: Playwright with persistent context
- Communication: Telegram bot integration

## Rules for Agents
1. Read before writing: Always read existing files before modifying them.
2. Preserve patterns: Follow existing code conventions (ESM imports, .js extensions in imports, async/await).
3. Documentation matters: Update docs/version_log.md when making significant changes.
4. Don't break the server: The backend runs on port 3000, the dashboard on port 5173. Don't change these.
5. Test your changes: Run "npx tsc --noEmit" to verify TypeScript compiles cleanly.
6. Environment variables: All secrets live in .env - never hardcode API keys.

## What You Can Do
- Read and modify any file in this workspace
- Analyze the codebase structure and suggest improvements
- Create issues and track work via GitHub/Local tickets
- Review documentation for accuracy
