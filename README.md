## ✨ v12.0 — Autonomous AI Company Orchestration (NEW)

### 🏢 AI Organisations
- **Create up to 10 independent AI companies** with unique names, missions, and root directories.
- **Org Isolation** — Each organisation operates in its own workspace with no cross-org data pollution.
- **Persistence** — All org data, agent memories, and shared company state saved to `memory/orgs/`.

### 👥 Professional Agent Personas
- **Custom Roles** — Define any role (CEO, CTO, Lead Dev, Marketing, etc.).
- **Rich Identity** — Every agent has a dedicated name, personality, responsibilities, and specific goals.
- **Autonomous Memory** — Agents maintain persistent memory across runs, learning from their own past actions.
- **Shared Memory** — A company-wide context board visible to all agents in the organisation.

### 💓 Heartbeat & Trigger Engine
- **Cron Scheduling** — Set precise execution times for any agent (e.g., "Daily at 9 AM", "Every 15 minutes").
- **Event-Driven Workflows** — Delegation automatically triggers heartbeats for target agents.
- **Manual Control** — Trigger any agent run instantly from the dashboard or chat.
- **Skip-if-Running** — Smart concurrency protection ensures heartbeats never stack or overlap.

### 📋 Enterprise Ticket System
- **Kanban Task Board** — Manage work via Open → In Progress → Blocked → Done status.
- **Agentic Delegation** — Agents can create, update, and assign tickets to each other or to you.
- **Rich Context** — Each ticket includes descriptions, priority levels, comments, and full history trails.
- **Write-Lock Protection** — Concurrent agent access is safe from data corruption.

### 💬 Direct Agent Chat
- **Instant Communication** — Click any agent to open a dedicated, persistent chat session.
- **Separate Workspace** — Direct-chat panes are independent of the 3-pane human command center.
- **Persistent Sessions** — The agent retains full context of your direct conversation between messages.

### 🧩 Previous (v11.1) Improvements
- **Multi-Chat Workspace** — Up to 3 independent resizable panes for human commands.
- **Sub-Agent Workers** — Spawn up to 5 parallel workers per pane for background tasks.
- **Skill Lock System** — Global concurrent resource protection (Exclusive/Read-Write/Per-Path).
- **Graceful Shutdown** — Cleanly stops all heartbeats and saves all sessions before exit.

### 📊 Previous (v10) Features Still Included
- Event Bus, Audit Logger, Session Manager, REST API
- HTTP Requests, Network Diagnostics, Process Manager, Deep System Info
- Performance Tracking, 23 Slash Commands, Session Restore, Full-Text Search
- Command Palette (Ctrl+K), Activity Feed, Tool Progress, Sparkline Charts
- PDF Management, AI Image Generation, Browser Extension Relay, Native Chrome
