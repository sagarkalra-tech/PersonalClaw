# PersonalClaw v12.8 🛸

**The next-generation Windows AI agent. Local. Private. Unstoppable. Now on Android.**

Deploy an autonomous digital workforce on your Windows machine — and control it from anywhere via the Android app. Create entire organisations of AI agents that collaborate, delegate, and execute complex workflows without cloud overhead.

## ⚡ 30-Second Demo
1. **Create an Org**: Launch `start.bat` and define your company mission (e.g., “Build a SaaS”).
2. **Assign Roles**: Spawn a CEO, CTO, and Lead Dev.
3. **Set a Task**: Create a ticket (“Build a landing page”).
4. **Watch it Work**: Agents use Browser Relay, Vision, and PowerShell to complete the task autonomously.
5. **Go Mobile**: Open the Android app — chat, manage orgs, approve proposals, and get push notifications from anywhere.

## 🏗️ Why PersonalClaw?

### 🔐 100% Private & Local
Unlike cloud agents, your agent memories, workspace files, and system interactions never leave your machine. PersonalClaw uses Google Gemini locally via API with data isolation for up to 10 independent organisations.

### 🤖 Autonomous Multi-Agent Orchestration
Not just a chatbot. PersonalClaw uses a professional Kanban system where agents (CEO, CTO, Marketing, etc.) collaborate via an internal ticket board. They delegate, raise blockers, and propose code changes.

### 🛠️ 31+ Core System Skills
From **authenticated browser automation** (via extension relay) to **PowerShell system control**, **automated social media posting** (Twitter/LinkedIn), and **Gemini Vision analysis**, PersonalClaw has the “hands” to do real work.

### 📱 Android App — Control From Anywhere
Full-featured React Native app with real-time chat, org management, voice input (hold-to-talk), and push notifications. Approve proposals, resolve blockers, and monitor agents — all from your phone. Connects securely via Cloudflare Tunnel.
